        <p>
            I (Artem Rakhmatulin) built the Scholar Application as a Free Application. This Application is provided by me at no cost and is intended for use as is. This page is used to inform users regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Application. If you choose to use my Application, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Application. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in my Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Scholar unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

        <h2>Log Data</h2>
        <p>
            I want to inform you that whenever you use my Application, in a case of an error in the Application I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data.

        <h2>Application Providers</h2>
        <p>
            I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate my Application;</li>
            <li>To provide the Application on my behalf;</li>
            <li>To perform Application-related services; or</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how my Application is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I want to inform users of this Application that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on my behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
        </p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>
        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>
            This Application may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites.
